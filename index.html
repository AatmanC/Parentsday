    <br>
    <p>
        You, you both,
        <br>
        Took an oath!
        <br>
        That you will care for me,
        <br>
        You did! Me too! Me three!
        <br><br>
        You said you will do anything I want,
        <br>
        Well, you did that too!
        <br>
        I love you!
        <br><br><br>
